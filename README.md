# Sávio S. C. Mendes

Software engineer focused on functional programming, runtimes/VMs, and deterministic systems.

## Focus areas
- Functional programming: semantics, type systems, standard libraries
- Runtimes/VMs: evaluators, interpreters, parallel evaluation, determinism
- Formal methods: verification-oriented design, proof-friendly code structure
- Blockchain: execution environments, smart-contract infrastructure, consensus-related systems
- Simulations: state machines, rollback logic, deterministic engines
- Performance: profiling, fixed-point arithmetic, low-level optimization

## Work themes (what you will find in this profile)
- Runtime implementations and tooling around functional cores
- Deterministic data pipelines and stateful systems (modeled explicitly)
- High-performance numeric code (fixed-point, BigInt strategies, low allocation)
- Distributed / concurrent execution experiments

## Technologies
**Languages:** Rust, Haskell, Agda, TypeScript, C, CUDA, Elixir, Python  
**Topics:** compilers, interpreters, virtual machines, formal verification, distributed computation, performance optimization
