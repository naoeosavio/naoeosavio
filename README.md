## About Me

My name is **Sávio**, and I’m a **software engineer** passionate about **functional programming**, **blockchain**, and **high-performance computing**.  
I believe that **mathematical rigor**, **pure functions**, and **deterministic systems** are the foundations of reliable, verifiable, and scalable software.

I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science**  
Since then, I’ve focused my career on exploring how **functional programming principles** can be applied to real systems — from **language design** and **formal verification** to **runtime optimization** and **distributed computation**.

Main interests:
- 🧩 **Functional programming languages** — semantics, compiler design, and standard libraries.  
- ⚙️ **Virtual machines and interpreters** — deterministic evaluation, lambda calculus, and parallel execution.  
- 🔗 **Blockchain infrastructure** — smart contracts and functional consensus systems.  
- 🎮 **Game systems & simulations** — state machines, rollback logic, and functional engines.

### 🧠 Philosophy

I view software as both a **mathematical and creative discipline**.  
Whether it’s a runtime, blockchain node, or simulation, I aim for **predictable, elegant, and efficient code** — code that can be reasoned about, proven correct, and scaled safely.  

I’m particularly inspired by projects that bridge **theory and practice**, where **formal methods** meet **real performance**.
